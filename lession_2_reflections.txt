What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git is signalled that this is not just a directory, but a repository.
Otherwise every directory will have to be a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows flexibility in choosing exactly which files
should be included in a commit before actually doing it. It is a 
temporary snapshot of what is about to be commited in the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?
By checking changes in previous commits and in the working directory
you can be sure that only what you are interested in will be commited.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?
When trying to do experiments with new functionalities, but I want a 
stable version as a backup.
