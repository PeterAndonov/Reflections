When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?
On large projects where multiple people work on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Other people might commit changes which are not finished and automatic
sync might cause problems.
