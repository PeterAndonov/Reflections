When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?
On large projects where multiple people work on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Other people might commit changes which are not finished and automatic
sync might cause problems.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When
would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copies of other people`s repositories on GitHub only.
Clones are copies of repositories either from GitHub to a local one or
a copy of a local one on a different location.
Branch is a different version of a file or files in a single repository
either local or on GitHub.
